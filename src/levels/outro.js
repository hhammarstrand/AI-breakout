`what your team just did, in plain terms:

  L1  retrieval-augmented analysis
      pasting heterogeneous sensor + image data into an LLM and asking
      it to triangulate. this is the simplest, most universal AI use.

  L2  multi-step reasoning + code-of-thought
      identifying cipher type, applying the right inverse, reading the
      decoded text for meaning. AI handles the mechanical decoding so
      you can focus on synthesis.

  L3  AI as pair-programmer
      AI wrote a graph search for you in seconds. you verified by reading
      the output. this is how AI changes day-to-day engineering.

  L4  human-in-the-loop verification
      the morse was something AI could decode trivially. but assembling
      the final code from four heterogeneous fragments — that needed you.
      this is the pattern: AI does the bulk, humans close the loop.

share your score with the room. then come back to base camp for debrief.`,
